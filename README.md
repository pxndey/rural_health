The datasets are taken from Kaggle and trained on Kaggle's Notebook Platform. The notebooks are in this github repository as well, but the links for the notebooks used are given below, for reference.

- Exploratory data analysis on [Rural Healthcare Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anushkpandey/kagglenb01) and [Hospitals and Beds in India](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anushkpandey/kagglenb02)
- [Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anushkpandey/kagglenb03) using MobileNet, ResNet152 and VGG16 models
- [Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anushkpandey/kagglenb04) using a Deep Neural Network, Logistic Regression and Random Forests Classifiers
- [Skin Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anushkpandey/skincancer-1-mobilenet) using MobileNetv3, InceptionNetv3, and VGG19, among other pre-trained models.
